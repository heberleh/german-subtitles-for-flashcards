# Movies and series for flashcards in German
This repo lists movies and series with good match between audio and subtitles in German. It also has a list of OK matches and bad matches, so to avoid double checking.

You find a [German Content](#german-content) table too, where German channels with good subtitles are listed.

Having the words that we hear matching what is written in the subtitles is an important aspect for creating
flashcards with tools like Migaku and sub2str.

Feel free to contribute.

# Tables
The following tables have a column (Where, how and when) that indicates 
which system was used (Netflix, etc), the country of access 
(if you set a VPN to use a German server, you write DE) and the year 
when the subtitles were checked.

Season should be a number (1), a list (1,3,4), a range (1-6), or the word 'movie'.

Ok movies/series should have almost good matches. Deutsch CC falls  here if it doesn't match what we hear.
Example: Biohakers has Deutsch CC subtitles and most of the times doesn't match what we hear, however, it is very close.

| :-- | :--: | :--: |
