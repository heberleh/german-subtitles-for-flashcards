# Movies and series for flashcards in German
This repo lists movies and series with good match between audio and subtitles in German. It also has a list of OK matches and bad matches, so to avoid double checking.

You find a [German Content](#german-content) table too, where German channels with good subtitles are listed.

Having the words that we hear matching what is written in the subtitles is an important aspect for creating
flashcards with tools like Migaku and sub2str.

Feel free to contribute.

# Tables
The following tables have a column (Where, how and when) that indicates 
which system was used (Netflix, etc), the country of access 
(if you set a VPN to use a German server, you write DE) and the year 
when the subtitles were checked.

Season should be a number (1), a list (1,3,4), a range (1-6), or the word 'movie'.

# Good matches

Good movies/series should feel like 95% of the phrases we read match perfectly with what we hear, i.e. same words are used in most of sentences.

| Title  | Aus Germany | Season | Where, how and when |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | 
| Caché | | movie | Netflix.de.2021 |
| Der Hobbit - eine unerwartete Reise | | movie | Netflix.de.2021 |
| Girl on the train | | movie | Netflix.de.2021 |
| How to sell drugs online | | 1 | Netflix.de.2021 |

<!--| title  | season | country | validation date |-->

# Ok matches

Ok movies/series should have almost good matches. Deutsch CC falls  here if it doesn't match what we hear.
Example: Biohakers has Deutsch CC subtitles and most of the times doesn't match what we hear, however, it is very close.

| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | 
| Biohackers  | yes | 2 | Netflix.de.2021 |
| Dogs of Berlin  | yes | 2 | Netflix.de.2021 |
| Goodbye Lenin  | yes | movie | Netflix.de.2021 |
| Mann tut was Mann kann | | movie | Netflix.de.2021 |


# Bad matches

Bad matches movies/series feel like most of the time the phrases have at least 1 word different than what we hear.
