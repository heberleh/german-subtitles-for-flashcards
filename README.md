# Movies and series for flashcards in German
This repo lists movies and series with good match between audio and subtitles in German. It also has a list of bad matches, so to avoid double checking.

Having the words that we hear matching what is written in the subtitles is an important aspect for creating
flashcards with tools like Migaku and sub2str.

Feel free to contribute.

# Tables
The following tables have a column (Where, how and when) that indicates 
which system was used (Netflix, etc), the country of access 
(if you set a VPN to use a German server, you write DE) and the date of
when the subtitles were checked.

Season should be a number (1), a list (1,3,4), a range (1-6), or the word 'movie'.
